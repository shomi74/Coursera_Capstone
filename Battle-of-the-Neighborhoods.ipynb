    "#### A. Background\n",
    "This notebook is about comparing different neighborhoods of Toronto to search for optimal location of coffee shop with low neighbourhood crime rate. Toronto is the capital of Ontario province and the most populous city in Canada. It is characterized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. The visible minority group here is more than 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coffee shop business is one of the strengths of its highly diversified economy. The city of Toronto has 140 neighbourhoods.  The best neighbourhood with coffee shops being most common venue will be sorted from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Business Problem\n",
    "The XYZ comapany is willing to open a new coffee shop in a comparatively populated neighbourhood of Toronto with lowest crime rate. The coffee shops should be popular in that neighbouhood. "

    "The XYZ company has emphasized on the neighbourhood with lowest crime rate. So it is required to find out -\n",

    "- **Which neighbourhoods have the lowest crime?**\n",
    "- **Is population density correlated to the crime level?**\n",

    " \n",
    "- **What venues are the most common in different locations within the neighbourhoods with lowest crime rate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have a clear piture of neighbourhoods with lowest crime rate but famous for coffee shop. Then the query to be answered is -\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the densely pouplated neighbourhood fullfilling the above requirements?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the answer of the above questions, the City of Toronto will be segmented into different neighbourhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood, and then using a combination of location data and machine learning, the neighborhoods will be grouped into clusters. It is required to leverage location  data to get deeper insights into a neighborhood's reputation. "
